# Q

"Q" game was initially released on SonyEricsson mobile phones. It represents logic game with balls and holes to where you should roll the balls up. This is "one more" version of the game written in Java.

## Getting Started

Just download the game:
```
> git clone https://github.com/JolyRoger/QGame.git
```

### Prerequisites

You should have [gradle](https://gradle.org/) - the tool to build and run the game.
Also [Java 8](https://java.com/ru/download/) have to be installed.

### Running

Then go to the game directory and run it with gradle:

```
> cd QGame
> gradle run
```

###Control

Select a ball in white frame with "Space" key. The frame becomes red. Move ball in red frame using arrow keys. When you want to release the ball press "Space" again. The red frame turns back to white. Move the frame over the balls till the frame is on ball you want to move. When you roll up a ball into the proper hole the frame automatically is set on a next ball. The goal of Q game is rolling up all the balls to appropriate holes.
